# Hebrew keyboard layout with Dvorak layer for modifier keys.

## Why?

MacOS non-Latin keyboard-layouts (such as Arabic, Hebrew and many others) use the QWERTY layer for modifier keys (Command/Fn/Shift/Capslock).


This means that as a user of Dvorak and Hebrew layouts, I have to use different application hot-keys depending on the currenty layout. For example, if you use the Cmd-L shortcut a web browser to focus the URL bar, you'll trigger the print Print dialgue if you're not careful because the 'P' key in the Qwerty layout maps to 'L' in Dvorak.


By using the same modifier keys layout, one doesn't have to constantly be aware of the currently selected language when performing keyboard shortcuts, which in most applications are not language specific.

## How?

[Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) is a keyboard layout editor for macOS, which allows you to export a layout as an installer disk image, which you can find in this repository, along with the source file, which you can edit and generate your own installer in Ukelele.
